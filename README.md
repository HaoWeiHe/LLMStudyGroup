# LLM Study Group Notebook: Kaggle Competition - Fraud Detection

This notebook is designed for the LLM Study Group and focuses on the Kaggle competition for fraud detection.

## Overview

The **IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection** competition is hosted on Kaggle in collaboration with IEEE and the Data Science Institute (CIS). The goal is to develop models that accurately identify fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques.

## Competition Details

- **Host**: Kaggle, IEEE, and the Data Science Institute (CIS)
- **Objective**: Build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions.
- **Data Source**: [Kaggle Competition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection/data)

## Sections

### 0. Data Import from Kaggle

**Description**: Import the dataset provided by the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection competition. This data will be used for building and evaluating the fraud detection model.
